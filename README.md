# Social Network API

## Your Task

I was tasked to  build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. I will use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

I have to provide seed data test it it with Insomnia after I created the API.

## Screen Shots

The following screen shot show examples of the application's API routes being tested in Insomnia.

The following animation shows GET routes to return all users and all thoughts being tested in Insomnia:
